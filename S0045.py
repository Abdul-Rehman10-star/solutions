# Exercise "Cars":

# Copy this file into your own solution directory. Write your solution into the copy.

# define a function that prints a car's motor sound (for example "roooaar")

# in the main program:
# define variables which represent the number of wheels and the maximum speed of 2 different cars
# print out these properties of both cars
# then call the motor sound function

# if you have no idea how to begin, open S0046.py and start from there

# when your program is complete, push it to your github repository and
# compare it to the teacher's solution in S0047.py
# then send this Teams message to your teacher: i am done with exercise "cars" (in a language of your choice) :-)
