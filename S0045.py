# Exercise "Cars":


# define a function that prints a car's motor sound (for example "roooaar")

# in the main program:
# define variables which represent the number of wheels and the maximum speed of 2 different cars
# print out these properties of both cars
# then call the motor sound function

# run the program with shift+f10 (or click on the green arrow)

# if you have no idea how to begin, open S0046.py and start from there
