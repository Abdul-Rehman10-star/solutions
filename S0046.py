# Exercise "Cars" (with a little help):

# Copy this file into your own solution directory. Write your solution into the copy.

# replace the zeros with your own code

# define a function that prints a car's motor sound (for example "roooaar")

# in the main program:
# define variables which represent the number of wheels and the maximum speed of 2 different cars
# print out these properties of both cars
# then call the motor sound function

# run the program with shift+f10 (or click on the green arrow)

# if you get stuck, ask google, the other pupils or the teacher (in this order).
# if you are still stuck, open S0047.py and compare it with your solution

#

def drive_car():
    print(0)  # print a sound


car1_wheels = 4  # define number of wheels for car1
0  # define maximum speed for car1
0  # define number of wheels for car2
0  # define maximum speed for car2

print("wheels", car1_wheels, 0, 0)  # print out the properties of car1
0  # print out the properties of car2

0  # call drive_car
