# Exercise "Morris The Miner"

# Copy this file into your own solution directory. Write your solution into the copy.

# Initial situation:
# Morris has the attributes sleepiness, thirst, hunger, whisky, gold.
# All attributes have the starting value 0.
# If sleepiness, thirst or hunger goes above 100, Morris the miner dies.
# Morris canâ€™t store more than 10 bottles of whisky.
# Sleepiness, thirst, hunger do not go below 0.
# Morris can't shop or eat without enough gold.

# Possible moves for a turn:
# sleep:      sleepiness-=10, thirst+=1,  hunger+=1,  whisky+=0, gold+=0
# mine:       sleepiness+=5,  thirst+=5,  hunger+=5,  whisky+=0, gold+=5
# eat:        sleepiness+=5,  thirst-=5,  hunger-=20, whisky+=0, gold-=2
# buy_whisky: sleepiness+=5,  thirst+=1,  hunger+=1,  whisky+=1, gold-=1
# drink:      sleepiness+=5,  thirst-=15, hunger-=1,  whisky-=1, gold+=0

# Your task:
# Write a program that gets Morris as much gold as possible in 1000 turns.

# if you get stuck, ask google, the other pupils or the teacher (in this order).

# when your program is complete, push it to your github repository
# then send this Teams message to your teacher: i am done with exercise "Morris The Miner"
# thereafter go on with the next file in numerical order in the teacher's exercise repository after the current exercise.
