# Exercise: Object oriented role playing game, part 2 :

# build on your solution of part 1

# invent two new classes, which inherit from class Character. For example Hunter and Magician.
# your new classes shall have their own methods and/or attributes. Maybe they also override methods or attributes from class Character.

# in the main program, let objects of your new classes fight against each other until one character is dead
# print out what happens during the fight

# if you get stuck, ask google, the other pupils or the teacher (in this order).

# when your program is complete, push it to your github repository and
# then send this Teams message to your teacher: i am done with exercise "role playing game 2"

# then go on with S0080.py
