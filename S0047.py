# Exercise "Cars" (Solution):

# Inspect this code in detail. Especially if you did not come up with a solution yourself.
# Find out what every line of code does. For example by changing the code a bit.

def drive_car():
    print("WROOOOOOOOM!")


car1_wheels = 4  # define number of wheels for car1
car1_maxspeed = 160  # define maximum speed for car1
car2_wheels = 8  # define number of wheels for car2
car2_maxspeed = 100  # define maximum speed for car2

print("wheels", car1_wheels, "maximum speed", car1_maxspeed)  # print out the properties of car1
print("wheels", car2_wheels, "maximum speed", car2_maxspeed)  # print out the properties of car2

drive_car()
